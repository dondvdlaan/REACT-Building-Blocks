<h2>Building blocks for REACT, like navigation and reducer</h2>

<p>This repository is about a number of building blocks for the frontend REACT library. The
building blocks consist of tested code and can be compied in to any project.</p>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p>This building block consists of web navigation techniques, based on Material UI, like responsive top menu bars.</p>

<h3>Reducer</h3>

<p> A reducer (REACT useReducer) is used in REACT to centralize your actions(ie add/delete a product) on a certain topic (ie cart or department). Attached to a conext (REACT useContext), the reducer
is available application wide and avoids passing on props between the components.</p>
